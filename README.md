# ΛELITIUM
**Experimental metacognitive AI architecture (public site & papers)**

This repository hosts the public landing page and academic papers for ΛELITIUM.
It is **not** the full source code of the platform. The core implementation is
private and available upon request for academic evaluation.

## Overview
ΛELITIUM operationalizes three explicit reasoning layers:
- **Layer 1** — Standard expert analysis
- **Layer 2** — Metacognitive reflection ("I notice…")
- **Layer 3** — Meta-reasoning about the process
A "Genius Council" mechanism aggregates six historical-style perspectives
(Einstein, Jobs, Sun Tzu, Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, Da Vinci).

## What's in this repo
